Today's featured picture
[34mJam Gadang[39m
 is a 26-metre-tall (85¬†ft) 
[34mclock tower[39m
 and major landmark and tourist attraction in the Indonesian city of 
[34mBukittinggi[39m
, 
[34mWest Sumatra[39m
. The structure was built in 1926, during the 
[34mDutch colonial era[39m
, as a gift from 
[34mQueen Wilhelmina[39m
 to the city's 
controleur
. A figure of a rooster was originally placed on the apex, but this was changed into a 
[34mShinto shrine[39m
‚Äìlike ornament during 
[34mthe Japanese occupation[39m
 (1942‚Äì1945); following 
[34mIndonesian independence[39m
, the tower's top was reshaped to its present form, which resembles traditional 
[34mMinang[39m
 roofs. The tower was damaged in two earthquakes that struck the island in 2007 and was subsequently refurbished. It has been used as an observation post for fire control, and during 
[34mRamadan[39m
 the 
[34mcall to prayer[39m
 that marks the 
[34mbreaking of the fast[39m
 is sounded from the tower.
